# Portfolio-Website
Hello and welcome! 👋
I'm excited to share my personal portfolio website — a space where I showcase my passion for web development and design.

🎯 What You'll Find:

🚀 An overview of my journey as a web developer
📚 My educational background and the skills I've developed
🎨 A focus on front-end development, UI/UX, and responsive design, Python and so on
💡 Projects that highlight both what I've learned and what I'm currently exploring

🔧 What I used:
    HTML / CSS / JavaScript
    And, of course, a strong dose of curiosity and creativity 😄

    Here is the link https://saranya844.github.io/my-portfolio/ — feel free to explore! It's a responsive, interactive, and stylish website designed with attention to detail.

🛠️ Always Learning, Always Improving
              This portfolio is more than just a static showcase — it’s a growing project that reflects my ongoing development as a front-end developer. If you have feedback, ideas, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
